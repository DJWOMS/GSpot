<!-- ABOUT THE SERVICE -->
## About The Service

Channels is a service for interacting with a client. Our service includes two microservices. The first is the broker microservice, which listens on the broker's main channel, sends mail to the client. 
The second service is a chat, which serves to receive a websocket connection from the client and interact with it.

### Built With

* Rabbitmq 
* Redis
* MongoDB
* FastAPI
* Docker
* Python 3.11

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.


### Installation

The first thing to do is start the databus service to listen for events. To do this, you need to enter through the terminal to the directory `backend/databus` and run the command
1. ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
2. Next you need to rename the file `env.example` to `env.dev` in the channels directory
3. Next, in the chanels directory, you need to run the command
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
For the first launch, be sure to build the databus service. For all subsequent launches from the channels directory, you can run the command
   ```sh
   docker-compose up
   ```
