            "description": "Being stranded naked on the shore of a mysterious island, starving and freezing, you will have to craft, hunt and build to survive. Use experience and dexterity to tame, breed, and ride the primitive creatures that live in ARK.",
            "about": "Being stranded naked on the shore of a mysterious island called ARK, freezing and starving, you will have to hunt, gather resources, create items, grow crops, research technology and build shelters to withstand the weather. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame and breed the enormous dinosaurs and other primitive creatures that inhabit the island, and team up with or hunt hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and overcome challenges!\r\n\r\nThe following features have been present in the game since day one of launch in Early Access. We have many more features and enhancements planned for the game's long-term development plan, and here's what's available to you right now in ARK:\r\n\r\nTAME, TRAIN, BREED AND RIDE DINOSAURS IN A LIVING ECOSYSTEM\r\n\r\nDinosaurs, other creatures, and their breeding! - more than 50 creatures in early access and 100+ by the final release - can be tamed with a sophisticated capture and attachment system, including weakening an untamed beast to a complete stun and then grooming it with appropriate food. Once tamed, you will be able to give commands to your pet, which will depend on how well you have tamed and trained it. Level up pets will require food, they can carry items and equipment such as armor, can carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger animals can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a pterodactyl over snow-capped mountains, throw allies over enemy walls, chase through the jungle with your pack of raptors, break into an enemy base on a giant brontosaurus, or stalk your prey while sitting on the back of a fierce T-Rex! Become part of a dynamic ecosystem life cycle with your own food chain, where you're just one link, among many species of creatures fighting for dominance and survival. Pets can also be bred by mating with the opposite sex through sequential selection using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process involves both the incubation of eggs and the development of pregnancy in mammals! Or, simply put, breed and raise baby dinosaurs and other creatures!\r\n\r\nFOOD, WATER, TEMPERATURE, AND WEATHER\r\n\r\nYou must eat and drink to survive, using different kinds of plants and meats, including human meats, which have different nutritional properties. Providing fresh water for your dwelling and stocking it in your inventory is also a pressing problem. All physical activities consume food and water parameters, so long-distance movement is a threat to survival! The weight of your inventory forces you to move slower, and the cycle of day and night, along with capricious weather conditions, present another challenge through fluctuating ambient temperatures, causing your hunger or thirst to increase. Make fires or build shelters, and craft a variety of clothing and armor with variable appearances to protect yourself from physical damage and extreme temperatures using a dynamic heat and cold resistance calculation system, both indoors and out!\r\n\r\nGATHERING RESOURCES, BUILDING STRUCTURES AND PAINTING ITEMS\r\n\r\nBy cutting down forests teeming with trees and mining metal and other valuable resources, you can fabricate various items to build massive multi-level structures made up of complex connected parts, including ramps, bridges, pillars, windows, doors, hatches, remote-controlled gates, water pipes and cranes, generators, wires and all kinds of electrical devices, ladders, and more. Many buildings and objects can be painted to diversify the appearance of your home, and pixel-paintable signs, billboards with text and other decorative objects can be added. The shelter reduces the impact of extreme weather conditions and keeps you and your prey safe! Weapons, clothing and armor can also be painted to accentuate your image.\r\n\r\nPLANT, GROW AND HARVEST\r\n\r\nPick seeds of wild vegetation around you, plant them in your placed beds, water and feed them with fertilizer (after digesting food, everyone poops, these feces can then be composted, with some fertilizer better than others). Take care of your crops and they will grow, producing delicious and rare fruits that can then be used to make many elaborate recipes and in creating healthy tonics! Explore and search for rare plant seeds that have the most potent effects! With this opportunity to master and conquer ARK in a non-violent way, vegetarians and vegans can thrive!\r\n\r\nSUMMON HIGHER LIFE FORMS\r\n\r\nUsing enough rare sacrificial items in special summoning areas, you can attract the attention of one of ARK's mythical god-like creatures that will arrive for battle. Only the most experienced players with their pet armies will be able to defeat these monsters and gain valuable items to advance on the game's final objectives.\r\n\r\nTHE PLAN SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nCreate a tribe and add your friends to it, and all of your pets can be managed and become allies for any of your tribe. Your tribe will also have revival available at any of your home revival points. Promote your tribe members to administrators to reduce the burden of government. Distribute items and PINs to provide access to common settlements!\r\n\r\nROLE-PLAYING COMPONENT.\r\n\r\nAll items are created from blueprints, which have different characteristics and qualities, and require appropriate resources. More remote and rugged ARK locations tend to have better resources, with the highest mountains, darkest caves, and the depths of the ocean among them! Level up your game character by gaining experience for performing actions, level up your pets, and learn new \"engrams\" to be able to create items from memory without using blueprints, even after death! Customize your character's physical appearance by changing hair and eye color, skin tone, along with a host of body proportion modifiers.\r\n\r\nHARDCORE MECHANICS.\r\n\r\nEverything you make is sturdy and wears out during extended use, if it's not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character is left \"asleep\" in the game world. Your items in crates or with your character can be looted and stolen, so to achieve safety, you must fortify yourself, recruit a team, or get pets to guard your loot. Death is irreversible and means losing everything, and you can even stun, capture, and force-feed other players, using them for your own purposes, such as extracting blood for transfusion, collecting their feces to use as fertilizer, or using slaves as fodder for carnivorous pets!\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLORE AND DISCOVER\r\n\r\nThe mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment made up of many natural and man-made objects placed on the ground, underground and underwater. As you explore its mysteries, you will find the most exotic procedurally generated creatures and rare blueprints. You may also find explorer's notes, which are dynamically updated throughout the game and were written throughout the millennium by previous human inhabitants of ARK, who creatively described the creatures as well as the backstory of ARK and its animal life. Complete your in-game map through exploration, mark interesting places on it, and use a manufactured compass or GPS to meet other players, with whom you can communicate via local text and voice chat or long-distance radio. Build and paint signposts to help you find or trip other players... Also...how will you ultimately defy the Creators and conquer ARK? A certain ending to the game is already planned.\r\n\r\nA LARGE PERSISTENT WORLD AND META UNIVERSE\r\n\r\nOn servers with around 100 players, your character, your buildings, and your pets remain in the game world even if you quit the game. You can move your character and items between ARK servers using Obelisk terminals to download (or upload) your data from Steam! A whole host of worlds, each one a little different from the previous ones - so you can leave your mark and conquer them one at a time. Special themed events will be held in ARK for a limited time with corresponding valuable items!\r\n\r\nROBUST MOD SUPPORT BY MASTERMIND STEAM\r\n\r\nYou can play the single-player game and move your character and items between unofficial player servers - back and forth. Mod the game - fully supported by the Steam workshop and the customizable Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we created our ARK, use our maps and materials as examples. Create your own server and customize it exactly to your liking. We want to see what you create!\r\n\r\nHIGH-END NEXT-GEN VISUAL EFFECTS\r\n\r\nThe incredible super-realistic creature imagery of the ARK world is brought to life using the finely tuned Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic shading and global lighting, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc.), realistic volumetric cloud modeling, and the latest advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 visualization techniques. All this is complemented by music from the acclaimed composer of Ori and the Blind Forest, Gareth Cocker!",

If the main character fails to stop this deadly killing machine, then the whole world will be overrun and people will be turned into helpless slaves.\r\n\r\nThe power of the Germans is unimaginable, and exceeds several times that of the other leading nations. But the Nazis decided to multiply their power several times over, so they began to look for ancient artifacts that would help them bring the dead back to life and summon demons.\r\n\r\nSo here you will face not only experienced warriors armed to the teeth, but also various supernatural creatures. Luckily, BJ will also be able to use paranormal abilities, thanks to an artifact found in a sunken submarine.",

In front of him - a pioneer camp \"Sovenok\", and behind - the past life. To unravel what happened to him, Semyon will have to get to know the local residents better (and maybe even meet love), to understand the maze of complex human relationships and his own problems, solve the mysteries of the camp.
